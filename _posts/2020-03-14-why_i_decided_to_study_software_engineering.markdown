why I wanted  study to be a Engineering software Is because a year ago I was contacted by a private Software Engineer company that was recruiting regular peoples with different occupation back ground to work on projects after I would graduate from there software engineer learning program, but I had to take some type analyst test before I could be accepted into there program, so I took there test and have no idea if I past or not? so decided to call the software engineer company and email my recruiter and never gotten response back from email and a call back, so I decided to try get myself into a school or a bootcamp to become a software engineer because one I have experience in HTML, CSS and a little of phyon which I never want to school for these three code I tough myself a few years back, so now you know why I want to study for my Software engineering.
