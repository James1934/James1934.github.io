Well Variables and Methods is not that difficult to undestand If you can understand it meaning and how it to type it out correcty like this for example a Variables are essentially a way to store a value and assign a name to that value for reference purposes and also ranging from integers to strings of characters. I will also give you example for Methods. A method in Ruby is the def keyword, a method name, the body of the method, return value and the end keyword, I hope I can make this a little bit unstandable.
